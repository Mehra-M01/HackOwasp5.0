Planet Coin - Reclyling made Rewarding.

Problem statement-Verbwire

"Limited resources and lack of incentives often prevent
small businesses from implementing effective recycling
programs, resulting in increased waste and missed
opportunities for businesses to promote their social and
environmental responsibility".

Solution

"The project aims to address this problem by
creating a secure and transparent smart
contract on a blockchain platform that enables
businesses to reward their customers for
participating in recycling activities, promoting
sustainability and benefiting both businesses
and customers."

Tech Stack

. Solidity and Ethereum:
Solidity is a popular programming language used for writing smart
contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is the most widely
used blockchain platform for smart contract development, with a large
and active developer community. The tech stack for Solidity and
Ethereum includes tools like Remix IDE, Truffle Framework, and
Web3.js.

Use Cases

A smart contract can be used for recycling to incentivize individuals to recycle by rewarding them with
digital tokens that can be exchanged for goods or services. Here's an example scenario:
Let's say there is a small business that sells environmentally-friendly products, such as reusable water
bottles and bags. The business wants to encourage its customers to recycle their old plastic bottles
and bags by offering them a reward in the form of digital tokens. To do this, the business can create a
smart contract on a blockchain platform, such as Ethereum. The smart contract would specify the
terms of the recycling program, such as: Customers can bring in their plastic bottles and bags to the
store for recycling. For every 10 bottles or bags that a customer recycles, they will receive 1 digital
token. The tokens can be exchanged for discounts on the store's products, such as 10% off a reusable
water bottle.The smart contract would keep track of each customer's token balance and prevent them
from transferring tokens to unauthorized addresses. This ensures that the tokens are used for their
intended purpose and cannot be fraudulently redeemed.
